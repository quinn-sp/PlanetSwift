# PlanetSwift

PlanetSwift is an XML-based view layout system that provides an alternative to layouts using Interface Builder or only code while interoperating seamlessly with both. It provides stylesheet-like capabilites of using named values for colors or dimensions stored in a common file and a reusable style system that allows numerous properties to be inherited from other views defined in XML. PlanetSwift powers a number of apps shipped by [Small Planet](http://smallplanet.com).

## Getting Started

A set of playground pages is provided to get a quick exposure to the capabilities of PlanetSwift. To get playing:

1. Clone the repository and initialize its submodules

From the command line, you can initialize the submodules by typing `git submodule update --init --recursive` from within the repository.

2. Open `Examples.xcworkspace` in Xcode

3. Select the active scheme in Xcode to `PlanetSwift` and choose any iOS Simulator (not a Generic iOS Device or a physical device) and select `Project -> Build` or press CMD-B to build the PlanetSwift framework

4. Toggle open `PlanetPlayground` in the project navigator and select one of the visible playground pages (like `Introduction`, `StackView`, or `AutoLayout`)

5. If not already open, toggle the assistant editor to see a right pane in Xcode, and select `Live View` 

6. Run the playground and enjoy!
